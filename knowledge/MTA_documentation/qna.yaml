  - question: What is Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)?
    answer: >
      Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) is a set of tools that you can
      use to accelerate large-scale application modernization efforts across
      hybrid cloud environments on Red Hat OpenShift. MTA looks for common
      resources and known trouble spots when migrating applications.

      It provides a high-level view of the technologies used by the application.
      MTA also generates a detailed report that evaluates a migration or
      modernization path.

      projects and reduce the work involved.
