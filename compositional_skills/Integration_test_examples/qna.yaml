  - question: Can you generate an integration test to ensure that downward Metrics feature gate is not enabled by default?
    answer: |
      Test Case ID: CNV-10937
      Test case name: Downward Metrics feature gate is not enabled by default
      Description: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38687 
      Pre conditions:
        1. Install CNV
        2. Ensure feature gate is not explicitly enabled
      Test steps:  
        1. Create VM with downward metrics
      Expected Result:
        1. Creation of VM or access to any downward metrics endpoint fails. No end points exist.
  - question: Can you generate an integration test to test rhsm log after the registration in sca mode?
    answer: |
      Test Case ID: RHSS-291339
      Test case name: RHSM_Integration: test_rhsm_log_after_registration_in_sca_mode
      Description: Custom fields test_rhsm_log_after_registration_in_sca_mode
      Test steps:
        1. Set the log level to DEBUG in rhsm.conf
        2. Register in SCA mode against Satellite
        3. Check rhsm.log.
      Expected Result:
        1. Set the log level successfully
        2. Registration is successful
        3. No error like 'Installed product 479 not present in response from server' in rhsm.log
  - question: Can you generate an integration test to test list installed output after registration to sca mode?
    answer: |
      Test Case ID: RHSS-289591
      Test case name: RHSM_Integration: test_list_installed_output_after_registration_sca_mode
      Description: Custom fields test_list_installed_output_after_registration_sca_mode
      Test steps:
        1. Register guest against Satellite server with SCA mode
        2. Run list installed command
      Expected Result:
        1. guest successfully registers with the satellite server
        2. It's successful to show the output, and "Status", "Status Details", "Starts" and "Ends" dates are no longer displayed in the subscription-manager list --installed
  - question: Can you generate an integration test to test subscription manager syspurpose role set invalid?
    answer: |
      Test Case ID: RHSS-279730
      Test case name: RHSM_Integration: test_subscription_manager_syspurpose_role_set_invalid
      Description: Custom fields test_subscription_manager_syspurpose_role_set_invalid
      Test steps:
        1. Register guest against Satellite server
        2. Check the content of role syspurpose values by hammer or curl from the satellite side before set
        3. Set invalid role by subscription-manager syspurpose role --set
        4. Check the content of syspurpose values by hammer or curl from the satellite side
      Expected Result:
        1. guest successfully registers with the satellite server
        2. It's successful to check role syspurpose values from the satellite side before set
        3. It's successful to set syspurpose values and check message "Warning: Provided value 'foo' is not included in the list of valid values"
        4. It's successful to check role syspurpose values from the satellite side after set

      Test case name: RHSM_Integration: sca_list_repos_after_registration
      Description: Custom fields sca_list_repos_after_registration
      Test steps:
        1. Register system against satellite in sca mode
        2. Check repos enable option
      Expected Result:
        1. guest successfully registers with the satellite server
        2. It's successful to check repo enable option after registration in sca mode
