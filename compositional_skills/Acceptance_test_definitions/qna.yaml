      Acceptance testing, like system testing,  focuses on the behaviour of a
      whole system or product.  Objectives include:
      Establish confidence in the quality of the system as a whole 
      verifying that the functional and non-functional behaviours of the system are as specified
      Validating that the system is complete and working as expected
      Acceptance testing is used to access the system’s readiness for use by the customer.  Finding defects is often not the objective and finding them now would be considered a project risk.
    question: What is acceptance testing?
  - answer: |
      Common forms of acceptance testing are:
      User acceptance testing
      Operational acceptance testing
      Contractual and regulatory acceptance testing
      Alpha and beta testing
    question: What are Common forms of acceptance testing?
  - answer: |
      The Test Basis comes from:
      Business procedures
      User or business requirements
      Regulations, legal contract and standards
      User cases and/or stories
      System requirements
      System or user documentation
      Installation procedures. 
      Risk analysis reports
      Backup and restore procedures
      Disaster recovery procedures
      Non-functional requirements
      Operations documentation
      Performance targets
      Database packages
      Security standards or regulations
    question: Where does the test basis comes from?
  - answer: |
      Typical test objects include:
      System Under Test (SUT)
      System configuration and config data
      Business processed for a fully integrated system
      Recovery systems and hot sites
      Operational and maintenance processes
      Forms
      Reports
      Existing and converted production data
    question: What does typical test objects include?
  - answer: |
      Typical failures and defects:
      System workflows do not meet business or user requirements
      Business rules are not implemented correctly
      System does not satisfy contractual or regulatory requirements
      Non-functional failures such as security vulnerabilities, inadequate performance under high loads, or improper operation on a supported platform
    question: what are typical failures and defects in acceptance testing?
  - answer: |
      1. User acceptance testing - A type of acceptance testing performed to
      determine if intended users accept the system.
      2. Operational acceptance testing - A type of acceptance testing performed to determine if operations and/or system administration can accept the system.
      This might include:
      Testing backup and restore
      Installing, upgrading, etc
      Disaster recovery
      User management
      Maintenance tasks
      Data load and migration tasks
      Check for security vulnerabilities
      Performance testing
      3. Contractual acceptance testing - A type of acceptance testing performed to verify whether a system satisfies its contractual requirements.
      4. Regulatory acceptance testing - A type of acceptance testing performed to verify whether a system conforms to relevant laws, policies and regulations.
      5. Alpha testing - A type of acceptance testing performed in the developer’s test environment by roles outside the development organization.
      6. Beta testing - A type of acceptance testing performed at an external site to the developer’s test environment by roles outside of the development organization.
