      Integration testing focuses on interactions between components or
      systems.  Objectives include:
      Reducing risk
      verifying correct functioning of the interfaces
      Building confidence in the quality of the interfaces
      Finding defects in the in the interfaces or the components or systems
      Preventing defects from escaping to higher levels
    question: What is integration testing?
  - answer: |
      The characteristics of integration testing:
      Should focus on the integration itself and not the functionality of the modules
      Usually done by developers, while system integration is usually done by testers
    question: What are the characteristics of integration testing?
  - answer: |
      The Test Basis comes from:
      software and system design
      Sequence diagrams
      Interface and communication protocol specifications
      Use cases
      Workflows
      Component or system architecture
      External interface definitions
    question: Where does the test basis comes from?
  - answer: |
      Typical test objects include: Subsystems, Databases, Infrastructure,
      Interfaces, APIs and Microservices. 
    question: What does typical test objects include?
  - answer: |
      Examples of typical defects include:
      incorrect data, missing data or incorrect data encoding
      Incorrect sequencing or timing of interface calls
      Interface mismatches
      Failures in communication between components
      Unhandled or improperly handled communication failures between components
      Incorrect assumptions about the meaning, units, or boundaries of the data being passed between components
