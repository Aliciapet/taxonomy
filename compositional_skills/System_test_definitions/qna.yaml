      System testing focuses on the behaviours of a whole system or product.  Objectives include:
      Reducing risk
      verifying that the functional and non-functional behaviours of the system are as designed
      Validating that the system is complete and working as expected
      Building confidence in the system as a whole
      Finding defects
      Preventing defects from escaping to higher levels
  question: What is system testing?
- answer: |
      The characteristics of system testing:
      Should focus on the overall, end-to-end behaviour of the system as a whole.
      Often carried out by independent testers who rely heavily on specifications.
  question: What are the characteristics of system testing?
- answer: |
      The Test Basis comes from: software and system requirements, Risk analysis reports, Use cases
      Epics and user stories, Models of system behaviour, State diagrams and system and user manuals
  question: Where does the test basis comes from?
- answer: |
      Typical test objects include: applications, Hardware/software systems, Operating systems
      System Under Test (SUT) and system configuration and config data
  question: What does typical test objects include?
- answer: |
      Typical failures and defects in system testing:
      Incorrect calculations
      Incorrect or unexpected system functional or non-functional behaviour
      Incorrect control and/or data flows within the system
      Failure to properly and completely carry out end-to-end functional tasks
      Failure of the system to work properly in the system environment
      Failure of the system to work as described in system and user manuals
